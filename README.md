# spaced-repetition-simulator
How will due cards accumulate over time for a given spaced repetition algorithm and review schedule?

# Quickstart
Open the [simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Lb92PFBh7iN4AtZ4VaTBMmfHZvUEjOv2XMXuiNkCcQ/edit#gid=0), make your own copy and then use the custom menu at the top "Simulator > Quickstart". Check the [wiki](https://github.com/joshm21/spaced-repetition-simulator/wiki) for more advanced usage.

# Motivation
Have you ever wondered how different spaced repetition algorithms compare? Or how many cards you can add per day without flooding your review deck and getting behind? Or how long it will take to learn X words if you review Y cards per day? Or does it make more sense to review more mature cards or newer cards first? You can answer questions like this and more using this simulator. Check out the [examples page](https://github.com/joshm21/spaced-repetition-simulator/wiki/Examples) to see some of what is possible.
